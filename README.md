# Instant Copy Hub
Instant Copy Hub is a simple and easy to use text copy addon.  
# How to use  
## Add text  
Hit the Add button. Boom. An empty textbox will be added. Just keep whatever texts you want to keep there!  
## Manage text
By clicking the delete button, "Are you sure?" popup will appear and ask you if it's okay to delete the text.  
If that's your intention, then hit the OK button. If not, click the Cancel button.
